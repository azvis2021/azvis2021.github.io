## Welcome to AZ VIS 2021!

The University of Arizona and Arizona State University are jointly organizing an [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/) 2021 [satellite event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/call-participation/satellite) in Tucson, AZ, Oct. 24-29. 

### Who we are

This event will bring together multiple communities, including the [HDC](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/), [VADER](http://vader.lab.asu.edu/), and [SVL](https://chrisbryan.github.io/research/) visualization research groups. 

Additionally, this event interfaces with the larger Data Science communities
of both campuses, particularly the UA's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu/) and [UITS Research Computing](https://it.arizona.edu/research).


### What's happening during the week

Our satellite event will host viewing options for all of the virtual [IEEE VIS 2021 Program](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/week-at-a-glance), 6:00am-1:30pm MST daily (additional details forthcoming).

We plan to reserve space for the week in the [Biosciences Research Laboratories (BSRL)](https://bsrl.arizona.edu/content/floorplans) and the adjacent [Health Sciences Innovation Building (HSIB)](https://uahs.arizona.edu/scheduling/tucson-hsib).

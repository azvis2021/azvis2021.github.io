## Welcome to AZ VIS 2021!

The University of Arizona and Arizona State University are jointly organizing an [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/) 2021 [satellite event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/call-participation/satellite) in Tucson, AZ, Oct. 24-29. 

#### Who we are

This event will bring together multiple communities, including the [HDC](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/), [VADER](http://vader.lab.asu.edu/), and [SVL](https://chrisbryan.github.io/research/) visualization research groups. 

Additionally, this event interfaces with the larger Data Science communities
of both campuses, particularly the UA's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu/) and [UITS Research Computing](https://it.arizona.edu/research).


## What's happening during the week

Our satellite event will host viewing options for the virtual [IEEE VIS 2021 Program](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/week-at-a-glance), 6:00am-1:30pm MST daily (additional details forthcoming).

#### Local Programming

In addition to hosting events from the main conference, there will be local events in the afternoon after the main conference.  These events will help to highlight the exciting visualization work happening in southern AZ, build connections between the many communities, and offer opportunities for celebrating visualization.

Currently, we are anticipating hosting:

* A local doctoral colloquium
* VIS lighting talks
* Community mixer / birds-of-a-feather style sessions

Please check back for more details and the complete schedule here.

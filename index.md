## Welcome to AZ VIS 2021!

The University of Arizona and Arizona State University are jointly organizing an [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/) 2021 [satellite event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/call-participation/satellite) in Tucson, AZ, Oct. 24-29. 

#### Who we are

This event will bring together multiple communities, including the [HDC](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/), [VADER](http://vader.lab.asu.edu/), and [SVL](https://chrisbryan.github.io/research/) visualization research groups. 

Additionally, this event interfaces with the larger Data Science communities
of both campuses, particularly the UA's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu/) and [UITS Research Computing](https://it.arizona.edu/research).
